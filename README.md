# Snake-Ladder_python

Design and implement a Snakes and Ladders game in Python.
● There are 6 face dice which are being rolled by the player to their chance.
● The player starts from 0 and has to reach the final position (in our case, it's 100).
● There are some ladders which turn out to be lucky for the player as they shorten the way.
● There are some snakes present in between the game which turns out to be the enemy of the player as they just lengthen their way to 100.
● The position of snakes and ladders are stored in start:end format where start denotes the position of ladder/snake and end denotes the value that it reaches.

Position of snakes: {17 : 7, 54 : 34, 62 : 19, 98 : 79}
Position of ladders: {3 : 38, 24 : 33, 42 : 93, 72 : 84}

Structure:
● The game will only be text output based, i.e. no GUI will be shown to the user. Instead, it will use print statements to display the position of a particular player, end results etc.
● There are only 2 players in the game and no spectators are allowed.
● The first thing that the game will ask to input will be names of the players.

The input should first ask the name of Player 1 and then after giving input, it should ask the name of Player 2.
● The game will alternate between these 2 players.
For a particular player’s chance, it will ask to input his/her chance. If Player 1 enters “ roll ” (excluding quotes), then a random number will be generated between 1 and 6 (both inclusive).
The output will be shown and then the final position will be displayed each time a player plays his/her chance.

● The game consists of 2 modes: Auto mode and manual mode. For auto mode, a player will type roll and a random number will be generated
imitating the roll of dice. For a manual mode, instead of entering roll, players can enter any number between 1 and 20 and that particular
number will imitate that throw.

● The game will display your final position as a sum of last position and value of current chance. So let’s say your last position was 16, and you got a 6,
then the final position will be 22.
● Now here comes the interesting part. You will be provided the positions which contain snakes or ladders. You will also be provided with the values 
they are mapped to. If the final position corresponds to a snake or ladder then display the final position as that particular value.
● If either of the players reaches position 100, then that player will win and “Game Successfully Finished” will be printed. Also it will display which player won the game.

Remember not to overshoot the position 100. For example, if current position is 97 and value of dice is 6, then position will be the same i.e. 97 as
97+6 = 103 which is not possible.
● During any player’s chance, if he/she enters “quit” (without quotes), then the game will instantaneously end for that particular player and the other player will win the game.

Concepts required:
● List, Tuple, Dictionary
● Random number generation
● Iterations, conditional statements and functions
Libraries allowed:
● Random
